# basic-framework verification harness

This directory adapts the DeepSeek Harness engineering model to this repository.
It is not an upstream DeepSeek Harness runtime profile or a claim that upstream
defines a `.harness` file format.

The adaptation keeps four properties from the upstream model:

1. scoped `AGENTS.md` instructions carry durable engineering constraints;
2. capabilities are consumed through explicit seams rather than core patches;
3. mechanizable invariants are executable and blocking;
4. verification evidence matches the changed boundary.

The repository-root `AGENTS.md` remains the authority for engineering rules.
`verify.ps1` and `verify.sh` are platform providers for one named gate
topology: Windows development uses PowerShell and Linux CI uses POSIX `sh`.

```powershell
& .\.harness\verify.ps1 --list
```

```sh
sh .harness/verify.sh --list
```

## Durable and runtime boundary

Tracked harness files contain commands and scoped maintenance instructions only.
Credentials, `.env` files, container state, test reports, coverage output, logs,
and generated artifacts are runtime state and must stay outside `.harness/`.

## Change protocol

When adding or changing a gate:

1. place the rule in its authoritative document;
2. make a named gate reject a representative violation;
3. restore the valid state and record a green run;
4. wire the gate into the blocking CI aggregate;
5. update the repository README only when the developer entrypoint changes.
